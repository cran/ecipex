Description: Provides a function that quickly computes the fine structure
    isotope patterns of a set of chemical formulas to a given degree of
    accuracy (up to the limit set by errors in floating point arithmetic). A
    data-set comprising the masses and isotopic abundances of individual
    elements is also provided and calculation of isotopic gross structures
    is also supported.
